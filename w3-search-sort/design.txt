CIS 226: Advanced Python Programming
Total time estimate: 3 hours

Design: The design of the search_and_sort program was to display the efficiencies of
different searching and sorting algorithms. This program was to be implemented
using python and the pytest API.

Develop: To solve the problem, it was necessary in understanding how these algorithms work by 
researching/ using the given materials on some basic searching and sorting algorithms.

Test: The test_seach_and_sort.py file uses pytest to test the selection sort I implemented.
It accomplishes this by comparing the expected sorted array with the one given back to us from the my_selection_sort function.

Document: The search_and_sort.py file demonstrates to the end user implementations of various searching and sorting algorithms. 
The test_seach_and_sort.py tests the my_selection_sort() function.
