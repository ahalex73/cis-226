TOTAL TIME TO COMPLETE: --- 5 hours ---


Design: The design of the mygrep utility tool was intended for the end user
to use in a command line. This program was to be implemented using python and
the pytest API. 

Develop: To solve the problem, it was necessary in understanding system arguments,
file I/O, and researching the documentation of the pytest API. 

Test: In the simple test created we pass our test if the line given back in our
output contains "jacob" in the given text file "students.txt". The point
in this test is to ensure that our programs intended utility is working
properly.

The mygrep.py file is the program that the end user runs, it is what has the
functionality of finding a given search text within a given file. The 
test_mygrep.py file is to be used with a virtual enviornment running pytest, 
which tests to see if the given output is correct.
